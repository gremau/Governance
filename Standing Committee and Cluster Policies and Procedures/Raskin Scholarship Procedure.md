**Nomination Committee Process: **

The group identified four dimensions that they thought important:

\(1) Community outreach/collaboration - The group also considered to a
lesser degree organizational diversity

\(2) Geospatial Technology and/or Semantic Tech highlighted

\(3) Earth science focus

\(4) Impact that the award might have on their career

(4.5) Likelihood that they would connect with ESIP or maintain an
ongoing connection to ESIP.

The group then chatted to staff their top 2-3 candidates
